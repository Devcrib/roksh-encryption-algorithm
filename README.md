# roksh-encryption-algorithm
Here's how it all started... This is a library to facilitate the smooth communication in times of war, between Roksh - the petite village of farmers, and Zrytk - the fairly large village of blacksmiths and hunters Roksh is under massive assault from the four neighbouring villages - Slyek, Doek, Maroek and Groech. Rokshites need to be able to securely pass messages to and from their Zrytk saviours without standing the risk of the assailants intercepting.
